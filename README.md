# TikTok Claims Classification Project

This project simulates a real-world data analytics scenario at TikTok, focusing on building a predictive model to classify user-reported claims in videos and comments. The goal is to reduce the backlog of user reports and improve moderation efficiency.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The project follows a structured workflow to develop a machine-learning model for claims classification:

1. **Initial Data Inspection**:
   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
   - Checked for missing values and data types.
   - Generated summary statistics and initial visualizations.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted in-depth analysis to uncover patterns and insights.
   - Visualized trends and anomalies using Tableau.

3. **Statistical Testing**:
   - Validated assumptions and performed hypothesis testing.

4. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - Built a regression-based predictive model.
   - Optimized for accuracy and efficiency.

## üìä Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Data cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation and statistical analysis.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards for EDA.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Deliverables
