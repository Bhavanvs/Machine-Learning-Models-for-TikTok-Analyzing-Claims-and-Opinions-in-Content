# TikTok Claims Classification Project

This project simulates a real-world scenario at TikTok, focusing on building a predictive model to classify user-reported claims in videos and comments. The model aims to streamline the moderation process by prioritizing reports efficiently, reducing the backlog, and enhancing content review accuracy.

## üöÄ Project Overview

### Problem Statement
TikTok users can report videos and comments containing claims or opinions. These reports generate a significant volume of data that moderators must review manually, creating delays in addressing critical content. To overcome this challenge, TikTok is developing a predictive model to classify user-reported content as either a claim or an opinion. This model will:
- Reduce the backlog of user reports.
- Enable moderators to prioritize critical cases efficiently.
- Improve the overall content moderation workflow.

### Project Objectives
1. Inspect, clean, and analyze the dataset to understand its structure and quality.
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies.
3. Develop a robust predictive model to classify user-reported content.
4. Visualize and communicate findings to stakeholders effectively.

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow

1. **Initial Data Inspection**:
   - Loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Checked for missing values, data types, and outliers.
   - Generated summary statistics (mean, median, range) for key variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted detailed analysis to identify trends and patterns.
   - Created visualizations using Python and Tableau to highlight insights.

3. **Statistical Testing**:
   - Validated assumptions and performed hypothesis testing to ensure data reliability.

4. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - Built and trained a predictive model to classify claims and opinions.
   - Optimized model performance for accuracy and efficiency.

5. **Reporting and Visualization**:
   - Developed interactive dashboards in Tableau for stakeholders.
   - Summarized key findings in an executive report.
